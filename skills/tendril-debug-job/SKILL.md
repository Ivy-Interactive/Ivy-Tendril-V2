# tendril-debug-job

Analyze a job's execution artifacts to identify issues and improvement opportunities in Tendril, the promptware instructions, memory, or tools.

## Invocation

```
/tendril-debug-job <job-id> <comment>
```

* **job-id** - Five-digit job id (e.g., `00458`). A full path to a job log also works.
* **comment** - Free-text describing what to look for or what went wrong

## Job Artifacts

Every job writes four files, flat, into `$TENDRIL_HOME/Jobs/`. They share one stem:

```
{jobId}-{planId}-{promptware}      e.g. 00458-00044-ExecutePlan
{jobId}-{promptware}               when the job has no plan (e.g. CreatePlan)
```

| File | Name |
|------|------|
| `{stem}.md` | **Job Log** - status, timings, CLI command, final output, agent-authored `## Agent Log` sections |
| `{stem}.prompt.md` | **Job Prompt** - the exact prompt handed to the agent |
| `{stem}.raw.jsonl` | **Job Raw Log** - unparsed CLI stream-json output |
| `{stem}.eventwire.jsonl` | **Job Eventwire Log** - Tendril's parsed event stream |

Locate them with a glob on the job id:

```bash
ls "$TENDRIL_HOME/Jobs/00458-"*
```

The promptware type is the **last** dash-separated segment of the stem; the plan id, when present, is the middle segment. There is no `Logs/` folder anywhere - not under promptwares, not under plans.

## What This Skill Does

1. Reads the Job Log, the Job Prompt, and the Job Raw Log
2. Reconstructs the agent's execution timeline: tool calls, decisions, errors, retries
3. Cross-references with the promptware's Program.md, Memory, and Tools
4. Identifies concrete improvements to Tendril code, promptware instructions, or agent behavior
5. Produces actionable recommendations

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1 - Read the Job Log and Job Prompt

The Job Log (`{stem}.md`, produced by `JobLogger`) has this structure:

```markdown
# Job Log {stem}

- **JobId:** {id}
- **PlanId:** {planId}   # present whenever the job produced or targeted a plan
- **Status:** {Completed|Failed|Timeout}
- **Exit Code:** {0|1|N/A}
- **Started:** {timestamp}
- **Completed:** {timestamp}
- **Duration:** {seconds}s
- **Provider:** {claude|copilot|codex|...}
- **SessionId:** {id}
- **Cost:** ${amount}
- **Tokens:** {count}

## CLI Command
{full command line}

## Final Output
{agent's last text response}

## Outcome
{commits, verifications, final plan state - ExecutePlan/RetryPlan only}

## Agent Log - {action} ({timestamp})
{narrative the agent appended mid-run via `tendril job add-log`}
```

The compiled prompt is **not** in this file. Read `{stem}.prompt.md` for the full firmware + Program.md + references + custom instructions.

Extract:
- The promptware type and plan id (from the stem)
- The program folder: `$TENDRIL_HOME/Promptwares/{promptware}` (in a dev checkout, `src/promptwares/{promptware}`)
- Status, exit code, duration, cost, tokens
- The agent's own narrative from the `## Agent Log` sections
- The final output

### Phase 2 - Analyze the Raw JSONL

`{stem}.raw.jsonl` is the CLI's `--output-format stream-json` output. Each line is a JSON object with a `type` field:

| Type | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `system` | System prompt setup |
| `assistant` | Agent response with `content[]` array (text blocks and tool_use blocks) and `usage` (token counts) |
| `tool_result` | Result of a tool call |
| `result` | Final result text |

`{stem}.eventwire.jsonl` is Tendril's own parsed view of that same stream - use it when you want Tendril's interpretation (including `PermissionDenialEvent`) rather than the provider's raw wire format.

**Analysis approach (use targeted reads, never read the whole file if large):**

1. Count total lines: `wc -l`
2. Extract tool call patterns:
   - Grep for `"tool_use"` to find all tool calls
   - Count each tool type (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob)
   - Identify repeated reads of the same file (redundant work)
   - Find failed tool calls (look for `"error"` or `"is_error":true` in tool_result lines)
3. Token usage:
   - Sum `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` from assistant messages
   - Check `cache_read_input_tokens` vs `cache_creation_input_tokens` for cache efficiency
4. Error patterns:
   - Grep for `error`, `failed`, `exception` in tool results
   - Count build-fix-build cycles (consecutive Bash calls with compilation errors)
   - Identify thrashing (read-edit-read-edit on same file)
5. Timeline:
   - First and last timestamps for wall-clock duration
   - Long gaps between messages (rate limiting, slow tools)

### Phase 3 - Cross-Reference with Promptware Source

Read the promptware's source files from the program folder:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Program.md` | The agent's instructions - did it follow them? |
| `Memory/*.md` | Accumulated learnings - is anything missing or wrong? |
| `Tools/*` | Custom tools available - were they used appropriately? |

Check:
- Did the agent follow Program.md instructions in order?
- Did it skip steps or go off-script?
- Are there Memory entries that should have prevented a mistake?
- Are there Tools that should have been used but weren't?
- Did the compiled prompt provide sufficient context?

### Phase 4 - Cross-Reference with Tendril Source

Based on findings, check relevant Tendril source files:

| File | What It Controls |
|------|-----------------|
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/jobs/logger.rs` | Where every job artifact lives and how its stem is built |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/jobs/manager.rs` | Job lifecycle, dependency checking, completion verification |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/jobs/firmware_values.rs` | Firmware template, prompt compilation, and variable injection |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/jobs/recovery.rs` | Stuck plan recovery and startup reconciliation |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/agents/runner.rs` | Process execution, streaming json parsing, and output formatting |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/agents/providers.rs` | Agent provider configuration, tool permissions, and model specs |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/promptware/mod.rs` | Promptware compilation and firmware embedding |
| `src/crates/tendril-core/src/git/worktree.rs` | Git worktree creation, validation, and isolation |

### Phase 5 - Produce Recommendations

Output a structured analysis directly in the conversation (do NOT write files):

```markdown
## Execution Summary

- **Job:** {jobId} ({promptware}, plan {planId})
- **Status:** {status} (exit code {code})
- **Duration:** {duration}
- **Tokens:** {input + output} (cache hit: {ratio}%)
- **Tool Calls:** {count} ({breakdown by type})
- **Errors:** {count}

## Timeline

Brief narrative of what the agent did step by step.

## Findings

### {Finding Title}

- **Category:** {Instruction Gap | Memory Gap | Tool Gap | Tendril Bug | Token Waste | Error Loop | Permission Issue}
- **Severity:** {Low | Medium | High | Critical}
- **Evidence:** {specific tool calls, line numbers in JSONL, quotes from output}

{Description of the issue.}

**Root Cause:** {why this happened}
**Recommendation:** {concrete fix - which file, what to change}

---

{Repeat for each finding}

## Concrete Fixes (Priority Order)

1. **[Severity] {file path}**: {what to change and why}
2. ...
```

## Rules

* **Read-only**: Do NOT modify source code, promptware instructions, or memory files. Output recommendations only.
* **Always produce findings**, even if the execution was clean - "executed as expected" is a valid finding.
* **Be specific**: Cite JSONL line ranges, tool call sequences, and exact prompt sections.
* **The user's comment is your guide**: Prioritize investigating what they flagged.
* **Use targeted reads**: JSONL files can be huge. Use grep, offset/limit, and line counts rather than reading entire files.
* **Focus on actionable items**: Every finding should have a concrete recommendation pointing to a specific file.
* **Distinguish agent mistakes from system issues**: An agent going off-script is a Program.md problem; a tool failing is a Tendril infrastructure problem.
