# Ivy Tendril Extension Skill

This skill provides procedures and helper scripts for building, testing, packaging, and installing the Ivy Tendril extension directly into **Antigravity IDE** or VS Code.

## Directory & Environment

- **Extension Directory**: `extensions/vscode`
- **Antigravity Extensions Directory**: `~/.antigravity-ide/extensions`
- **Installed Extension Name**: `ivy-interactive.ivy-tendril-0.1.0`
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (fixed versions configured via `.npmrc`)

---

## Common Workflows

### 1. Install / Link to Antigravity IDE

To compile the latest extension bundle and link it live into Antigravity IDE:

```bash
skills/tendril-extension/scripts/install-antigravity.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd extensions/vscode
pnpm install
pnpm run build
mkdir -p ~/.antigravity-ide/extensions
ln -sfn "$(pwd)" ~/.antigravity-ide/extensions/ivy-interactive.ivy-tendril-0.1.0
antigravity-ide --list-extensions | grep "ivy-interactive.ivy-tendril"
```

After installing/linking:
1. Reload Antigravity IDE by opening the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and selecting **Developer: Reload Window**.
2. The Tendril sidebar view and commands (`Tendril: Open Dashboard`, `Tendril: Start Server`, etc.) are now active.

---

### 2. Package as `.vsix` Archive

To build a standalone VSIX distribution file:

```bash
skills/tendril-extension/scripts/package-vsix.sh
```

Or using the Node.js script:

```bash
node skills/tendril-extension/scripts/package.mjs
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd extensions/vscode
pnpm install
pnpm run build
npx @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies
```

> [!NOTE]
> Since Antigravity IDE runs VS Code engine `1.107.0`, installing a VSIX with an engine requirement greater than `1.107.0` via `antigravity-ide --install-extension` will be rejected by the version validator. The direct symlink method (Workflow 1) is the recommended approach for local development and daily usage.

---

### 3. Run Extension Tests & Typecheck

To verify extension integrity and TypeScript compliance:

```bash
node skills/tendril-extension/scripts/verify.mjs
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd extensions/vscode
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
```

---

### 4. Uninstall / Unlink from Antigravity IDE

To remove the extension from Antigravity IDE:

```bash
skills/tendril-extension/scripts/uninstall-antigravity.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.antigravity-ide/extensions/ivy-interactive.ivy-tendril-0.1.0
```
