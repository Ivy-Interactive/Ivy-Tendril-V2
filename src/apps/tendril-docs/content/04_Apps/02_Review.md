# Review

## What shows up

`ExecutePlan` (and similar) finishes in a frozen worktree. Review lists those plans and shows the result here.

## In the panel

- **Diff** — Changes vs. your tracked branch.
- **Verification output** — Logs from hooks (`DotnetBuild`, `NpmTest`, …).
- **Plan text** — Latest `revisions/*.md` (what the agent was implementing).
- **Git tab**: Worktrees, recorded commits and PRs for the plan, with a button to synchronize a worktree with its remote.

## Actions

| Action                  | Effect                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approve (Make PR)**   | Marks **Completed**, starts **CreatePr** on GitHub.                          |
| **Needs work (Revise)** | **UpdatePlan** on the same worktree with your feedback.                      |
| **Decline (Discard)**   | **Skipped**, worktree removed.                                               |
| **Manually resolve**    | Edit files in the workspace for small fixes without another full agent loop. |
