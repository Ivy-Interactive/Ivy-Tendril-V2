# Project Setup

## Adding a project

**Settings** – **Projects**, or edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: Global Engine
    repos:
      - path: ~/git/global-engine
    verifications:
      - name: Build
        required: true
      - name: Test
        required: true
      - name: CheckResult
        required: true
```

## Worktrees

`ExecutePlan` does not edit your normal working tree. It uses a **git worktree**: separate checkout, same repo, isolated from the branch you have open.

- Worktree is created for the agent; your main checkout stays as-is.
- Several plans can run across different projects concurrently.
- Failed runs are discarded without touching your IDE folder.
- After you approve, changes become a branch / PR as usual; the worktree is removed when done.

## Repo-local context

Optional files in the **repo root** (picked up when the agent runs):

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — High-level guidance for Claude Code.
- **`AGENTS.md` / `DEVELOPER.md`** — Team conventions and practices.

Tendril loads these and prepends them to the promptware context for that repo.
