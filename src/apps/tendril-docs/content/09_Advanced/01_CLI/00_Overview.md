# CLI Overview

Manage plans, projects, databases, and agents directly from your terminal. The `tendril` binary works as both a web server and a full-featured CLI tool.

Tendril CLI gives you complete control over your workflow without touching the UI:

- **Plans** — create, list, update, and inspect plans; manage repos, worktrees, verifications, and recommendations
- **Projects** — configure projects, their repos, build dependencies, and review actions
- **Verifications** — define and manage reusable verification checks
- **Config** — read and update top-level settings stored in `config.yaml`
- **Vault** — connect vaults, pull updates, inspect catalog assets, import and push projects
- **Database** — run migrations, inspect schema versions, or reset the database
- **Agents** — run and manage promptwares and their memory

## Quick Start

**1. Check your installation**

```terminal
>tendril doctor
```

**2. Start the web server**

```terminal
>tendril run
```

**3. Create a new plan**

```terminal
>tendril plan create "Fix login bug" MyProject
```

**4. List active plans**

```terminal
>tendril plan list --state Executing
```

**5. Reset everything and start fresh**

```terminal
>tendril reset
```

> [!TIP]
> Every command supports `--help` for detailed usage. For example: `tendril plan create --help`.

| Flag        | Short | Effect                                                 |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--verbose` | `-v`  | Enable detailed debug logging                          |
| `--quiet`   | `-q`  | Suppress informational messages (errors/warnings only) |

## Environment Variables

| Variable             | Purpose                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TENDRIL_HOME`       | Root directory for config, database, inbox, and plans                                                                                       |
| `TENDRIL_PLANS`      | Override plans directory (defaults to `TENDRIL_HOME/Plans`)                                                                                 |
| `TENDRIL_VERBOSE`    | Enable verbose debug output (set to `1`)                                                                                                    |
| `TENDRIL_QUIET`      | Suppress non-essential output (set to `1`)                                                                                                  |
| `TENDRIL_NOT_MASTER` | Run server without claiming master (set to `1`). Used for development/debugging — the instance won't accept CLI IPC or process inbox files. |

## Common Commands

#### doctor

```terminal
>tendril doctor
```

Validates your Tendril installation — checks `TENDRIL_HOME`, `config.yaml`, required tools (`gh`, `git`), `pwsh`, database schema, and agent model availability. Always a good first step when something isn't working.

#### plan doctor

```terminal
>tendril plan doctor
>tendril plan doctor --all
>tendril plan doctor --fix
```

Scans every plan folder and reports health: missing or malformed `plan.yaml`, stale worktrees, and plans left `Completed` over a failed verification. See [Plan](01_Plan.md) for the full option and health-code reference.

#### run

```terminal
>tendril run
>tendril run --port 8080
```

Starts the Tendril web server. Automatically applies pending database migrations before serving. Default port is `5010`.

#### reset

```terminal
>tendril reset
>tendril reset --force
```

Removes all Tendril data from the machine — deletes `TENDRIL_HOME`, `TENDRIL_PLANS`, and clears environment variables. On macOS/Linux, prints a reminder to remove the `export` lines from your shell rc file manually.

> [!WARNING]
> This permanently deletes all data. There is no undo.

#### report-bug

```terminal
>tendril report-bug --plan 03430
>tendril report-bug --job 00042 --description "Agent crashes on worktree creation"
>tendril report-bug --plan 03430 --dry-run
```

Collects plan files and every job artifact — the Job Log, Job Prompt, Job Raw Log and Job Eventwire Log from `<TendrilHome>/Jobs/` — into a zip archive and submits them to the Tendril bug report API, which opens a GitHub issue automatically.

| Option                 | Effect                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--plan <plan-id>`     | Include this plan folder plus every job that ran against it, including the `CreatePlan` job that authored it |
| `--job <job-id>`       | Include this job's four artifacts plus its plan's context (`plan.yaml`, revisions, worktree manifest)        |
| `--description` / `-d` | Bug description (prompted interactively if omitted)                                                          |
| `--yes` / `-y`         | Skip the confirmation prompt                                                                                 |
| `--dry-run`            | Show what would be sent without uploading                                                                    |

> [!WARNING]
> Attached files are posted to a **public** GitHub issue. If your plan contains sensitive data, use another reporting channel.

#### version

```terminal
>tendril version
```

Prints the installed Tendril version (e.g. `1.0.34`).

#### update-promptwares

```terminal
>tendril update-promptwares
```

Refreshes the embedded promptware templates from the bundled source. Run after upgrading Tendril to pick up new or updated promptwares.
