# GitHub

## Authentication

Tendril uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authentication. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate before using GitHub features.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure `gh` is installed and available on your PATH. Tendril will prompt you during onboarding if it is missing.

## Importing Issues

Use the **Import Issues** dialog to fetch GitHub issues and convert them into Tendril plans:

1. Open the **Drafts** app
2. Select **Import Issues** from the menu
3. Choose the target repository and filter by labels or milestones
4. Selected issues are converted into plans via the CreatePlan promptware

Each imported issue retains a link back to the original GitHub issue for traceability.

A single fetch returns up to 1000 open issues (GitHub's search ceiling); use the search, label, or assignee filters to narrow larger backlogs.

## Automatic PR Creation

When a plan reaches the **Completed** state, the **CreatePr** promptware automatically:

1. Pushes the worktree branch to the remote
2. Creates a pull request with a summary of changes
3. Links the PR back to the plan

Merge strategy, reviewers, draft status, and branch cleanup are chosen per PR in the Create PR dialog.

## PR Status Sync

The **PrStatusSyncService** monitors open PRs and updates plan state when PRs are merged or closed. This keeps your plan board in sync with your repository without manual intervention.
