# OpenCode

## Configuration

Set OpenCode as your coding agent in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
codingAgent: opencode
```

Or select it in **Settings > Coding Agent**.

For more details on `config.yaml` structure and settings, see [Setup & Settings](../03_Configuration/01_Setup.md).

## Requirements

- The OpenCode CLI must be installed and available as `opencode` on your PATH (`npm install -g opencode-ai`)
- Run `opencode providers login` to authenticate with your chosen model provider

## Profiles

Tendril maps effort levels to OpenCode models:

| Profile    | Model   | Effort | Use Case                     |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `deep`     | default | high   | Complex multi-file changes   |
| `balanced` | default | medium | Standard plan execution      |
| `quick`    | default | low    | Simple fixes and small edits |

OpenCode supports multiple backend providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) and manages model selection internally. Use `tendril models` to see discovered models.

The profile is selected automatically based on the plan's complexity level, or can be configured per promptware in `config.yaml`.

## Local Ollama Setup

When running OpenCode with local Ollama models, specify the server URL directly in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
codingAgents:
  - name: opencode
    environmentVariables:
      OLLAMA_HOST: "http://localhost:11434"
      OLLAMA_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:11434"
```
