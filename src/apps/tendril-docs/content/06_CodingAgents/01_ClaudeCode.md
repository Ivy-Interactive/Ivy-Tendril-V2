# Claude Code

## Configuration

Set Claude Code as your coding agent in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
codingAgent: claude
```

Or select it in **Settings > Coding Agent**.

For more details on `config.yaml` structure and settings, see [Setup & Settings](../03_Configuration/01_Setup.md).

## Requirements

- The Claude CLI must be installed and available as `claude` on your PATH (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Run `claude login` to authenticate before using Tendril

## Profiles

Tendril maps effort levels to Claude models:

| Profile    | Model  | Effort | Use Case                                      |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `deep`     | opus   | max    | Complex multi-file changes, architecture work |
| `balanced` | sonnet | high   | Standard plan execution, most tasks           |
| `quick`    | haiku  | low    | Simple fixes, formatting, small edits         |

The profile is selected automatically based on the plan's complexity level, or can be configured per promptware in `config.yaml`.

## Available models

| Model         | ID               | Context Window | Pricing (input / output per MTok) |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Claude Fable  | `claude-fable-5` | 1M             | $10.00 / $50.00                   |
| Claude Opus 5 | `claude-opus-5`  | 1M             | $5.00 / $25.00                    |
| Claude Opus   | `opus`           | 1M             | $5.00 / $25.00                    |
| Claude Sonnet | `sonnet`         | 1M             | $2.00 / $10.00                    |

`opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku` are Claude Code aliases that track Anthropic's current model for that tier, while `claude-opus-5` and `claude-fable-5` are pinned IDs.

Claude Sonnet's introductory pricing of $2.00 / $10.00 applies through 2026-08-31; standard pricing of $3.00 / $15.00 applies after.
