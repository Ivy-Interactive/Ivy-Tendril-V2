# Codex

## Configuration

Set Codex as your coding agent in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
codingAgent: codex
```

Or select it in **Settings > Coding Agent**.

For more details on `config.yaml` structure and settings, see [Setup & Settings](../03_Configuration/01_Setup.md).

## Requirements

- The Codex CLI must be installed and available as `codex` on your PATH
- Run `codex login` to authenticate before using Tendril

## Profiles

Tendril maps effort levels to Codex models:

| Profile    | Model         | Effort | Use Case                     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `deep`     | gpt-5.6-sol   | high   | Complex multi-file changes   |
| `balanced` | gpt-5.6-terra | medium | Standard plan execution      |
| `quick`    | gpt-5.6-luna  | low    | Simple fixes and small edits |

The profile is selected automatically based on the plan's complexity level, or can be configured per promptware in `config.yaml`.

### Supported Models

In addition to the default profile models, the Codex catalog supports models such as `gpt-6-astra` for manual selection or custom configuration in `config.yaml`.
